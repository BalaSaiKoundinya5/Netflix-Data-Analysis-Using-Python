**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Netflix Data**

**Project Overview**

This project involves conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python in a Jupyter Notebook to analyze data from Netflix. The analysis aims to uncover insights into viewing trends, content performance, and user preferences on the Netflix platform. By examining this dataset, the project seeks to identify key patterns and trends that can inform content strategy, marketing efforts, and user engagement.

**Objective**

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Content Analysis:** Examine the distribution of Netflix content, including genres, release years, and content types (movies, TV shows).
1. **Viewing Trends:** Analyze viewing patterns and trends, such as the popularity of genres over time and the average viewing duration.
1. **Content Performance:** Assess the performance of content based on ratings, number of views, and user engagement metrics.
1. **User Preferences:** Explore user preferences and behaviour, including genre preferences, content ratings, and viewing habits.
1. **Geographical Insights:** Investigate regional differences in content preferences and availability.

**Data Source**

The dataset used for this analysis includes detailed records of Netflix content and user interactions, with key fields such as:

- **Content Details:** Information on titles, genres, release years, content types (movie, TV show), and descriptions.
- **Ratings and Reviews:** Metrics on user ratings, number of reviews, and average ratings for each content item.
- **Viewing Data:** Records of viewing times, durations, and frequency of content watched.
- **User Data:** Information on user demographics, viewing habits, and genre preferences.
- **Geographical Data:** Data on content availability and user preferences by region or country.

**Key Analysis Techniques**

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
  - Handling missing values, outlier detection, and data normalization to ensure accurate analysis.
- **Descriptive Statistics:**
  - Calculation of summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation to understand content performance and viewing trends.
- **Visualizations:**
  - Use of bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and heatmaps to visualize content distribution, ratings, and viewing patterns.
- **Trend Analysis:**
  - Identifying trends in content popularity over time and analyzing shifts in user preferences.
- **Performance Analysis:**
  - Assessing the relationship between content attributes (e.g., genre, release year) and performance metrics (e.g., ratings, views).
- **Geographical Analysis:**
  - Mapping and comparing content availability and user preferences across different regions.

**Tools and Libraries**

- **Python:** The primary programming language used for data analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** The development environment used to write and document the code.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
- **Plotly:** For interactive visualizations.
- **Geopandas:** For geographical plotting and spatial analysis.

**Conclusion**

This project provides an in-depth exploratory analysis of Netflix data, offering valuable insights into content trends, viewing patterns, and user preferences. The findings from this analysis can guide content creation strategies, enhance user engagement, and inform marketing efforts on the Netflix platform.
